                        <p> I am Nhu Nguyen, currently a student trying to learn everything that is offered to me in the short four years of college. Unlike many people, I still have not found my passion. I like a variety of things: food, paper quillings, books stacked neatly, simple designs, black boots, facebook, etc. But I also have many things that I dislike, such as roller coasters and mice. Although it would be nice to know what I really want to do, not knowing my passion is not really a bad thing, for now. It has allowed me to try new things, taught me that it's ok to take risks and to make mistakes. I have taken classes that I would never thought of taking, experimenting with things I did not plan to do before coming to college. I try to see the bright side in everything I do, so that I can still fully enjoy my experiences even if I end up not finding my passion.
